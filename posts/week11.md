## In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?

Creative coding is actually a fun way for people to get into coding and Computer Sciene. Starting off with creating visual and auditory really encourage people to research more into the coding since it was fun and interesting to do.

Then, the more they learn about coding, the more they understand how network and server work, how the tech company actually doing with their website and app. With this, they have some what of an agency with their information and how they use the app.

People often are scared of the things they don't know and corperations really know how to play with those fears. So if coding is a compulsory subject, or even just a common knowledge, the myth about cyber attack, hacker and everything scary online won't be a problem anymore

The more people getting into coding, the more people will talk about it, and the more people understand how it works.Then, school will teach about it more, giving the new generation a basic understanding with coding and computer.

Therefore, I think, creative coding is a good start for those who want to learn more about coding and computer.
