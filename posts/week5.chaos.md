## Which of Ngai's aesthetic categories does your self-portrait (and glitch more generally) belong to, and why?

Glitch art is chaos and zany.

Zany is chaos, something unpredictable and often messes up the existing things. It's hysteria and maniac, though, still have a charm to its own aesthetic.

Zany is crazy, zany is unexpected, zany can be absurb, eccentric, different. You never know what is the next move of the chaos, since they always changing and creating new things.

In digital world, glitch is zany. We don't want it to happen, we don't want a scanned file to have a unexpexted object in it, we don't want a corrupted, pixelated photo, we don't want unreadable data.

But, people have found a way to enjoy the chaos, turned the unpexpected error into some form of art, **glitch art**. It's the art of chaos, the art of unexpected, and with moderation, it was turned into something beautiful, aesthetic, rather than just being an error.

## Does glitch increase or decrease effective complexity, and why?

Glitch often doesn't follow a rule. And while effective complexity although looks similar to chaos, actually does follow a rule.

Glitch decreases the effective complexity because it's no longer comprehensive. Everything about glitch is random, therefore, it's chaotic.
