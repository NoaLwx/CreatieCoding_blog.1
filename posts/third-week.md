`Cute` is intimate, fuzzy and warm, it can be handle and fold and shape the way we want, it incites us to take care of it.

And this make me wondering if cute can be the fuzzy feeling of looking at a cat and want to pet with it.

Cute can also be dangerous. Our brain thinks of cute and would try to touch things that aren't meant to touch. For example, the internet phenomenal with associating dangerous animal as cute, saying that, "if it's not friend, why friendshape?" (why they look fluffy and cute).
