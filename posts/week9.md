# 1 - Consider I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS Links to an external site., by Lauren Lee McCarthy Links to an external site.. In what way could you consider this project to:

## Be an example of mycelial creativity?

Mycelial Creativity is a form of biomimicry where people copy the processes, material design to solve complex problem. The term mycelial referring to the process of mushroom where they spread omnidrectionally and accumulatively in order to form an organic system

In 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS', Lauren was able to connect people around the neighbourhood to use something they might haven't made contact with before. And this is also a part of Community of Practice where they share values and opinion, in this case, about covid and the no speaking rule, with each others, throught Lauren's program.

## Belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?

It's interesting because it leaves us to think about it. It's a blank canvas where we can enter what ever we want to say, and express our ideas. It incites us to complete it.

Which is why it's interesting.

# Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your AT3 project.

## Ideas

### **Collage maker**

A share platform where people can upload pictures and enter text to make a collage with each other.

There is a function to take pictures or inserting it from the camera. I want to make a function where people can create their own artboard and allow other user to join in (no need to log in) so that it's not too big.

The idea was from the collab/duet function on tiktok where people can include their clips with another people for reaction for to add a new ideas to it. The most noticable post of this trend has to be where a tiktok user named @marcus.dipaola posted a
[video ](https://youtu.be/kEd-6HE005A?si=fSkuCzwMGAX2wwgP)introducing people to his girlfriend, Brittney.

Instead of taking this as a normal introduction video, people imagined that Marcus held Brittney hostage and duet his video adding their limbs in to complete the full picture.

I think it's fun for people to collab together to create a collage without any shared value, and maybe at the end of the collage, people will understand each other preference better?

I also want it so that people can save the image as a pdf

### Its domain

I am planning to test this on the camping group since we are going soon and we can make collage of the nature/camp. This will be a fun activity that can help preserve memories.

After the assignment, I might keep this website up for other occassion like hanging with friends or family so we can share put the memory together.

### Its shared values

People who likes taking picture, people who like collage. But they don't have to have the same interest to take part in this collage, they can experiment all they want, and can enjoy the result together.

### Its existing repertoire

aaaa

### How you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context

aaaa idk man
