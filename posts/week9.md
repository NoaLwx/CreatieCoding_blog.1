# 1 - Consider I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS Links to an external site., by Lauren Lee McCarthy Links to an external site.. In what way could you consider this project to:

## Be an example of mycelial creativity?

Mycelial Creativity is a form of biomimicry where people copy the processes, material design to solve complex problem. The term mycelial referring to the process of mushroom where they spread omnidrectionally and accumulatively in order to form an organic system

In 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS', Lauren was able to connect people around the neighbourhood to use something they might haven't made contact with before. And this is also a part of Community of Practice where they share values and opinion, in this case, about covid and the no speaking rule, with each others, throught Lauren's program.

## Belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?

It's interesting because it leaves us to think about it. It's a blank canvas where we can enter what ever we want to say, and express our ideas. It incites us to complete it.

Which is why it's interesting.

# 2 - Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your AT3 project. Please include:

## its domain

## its shared values

## its existing repertoire

## how you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context
